## Chat with PDF using Gemini

This Streamlit application allows you to ask questions about a uploaded PDF document using the power of Google's generative AI model, Gemini-1.5-pro. 

### Functionality

1. Upload one or more PDF documents.
2. Enter a question about the content of the uploaded PDFs.
3. The application will process the PDFs, generate embeddings for the text, and search for similar passages to answer your question.
4. The application will leverage Gemini-1.5-pro to provide a comprehensive answer based on the context of the PDFs.

### Requirements

This application requires the following Python libraries:

* `streamlit`: Used for creating the interactive web application.
* `google-generativeai`: Provides access to Google's generative AI models.
* `python-dotenv`: Enables secure management of environment variables.
* `langchain`: A collection of tools for building natural language processing workflows.
* `PyPDF2`: Used for extracting text from PDF documents.
* `faiss-cpu`: Provides an efficient similarity search library.
* `langchain_google_genai`: Integrates Google's generative AI models with langchain.
* `langchain>=0.0.267`: Ensures compatibility with other libraries.

### Running the Application

1. Install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Make sure you have a Google Cloud project with the Generative AI API enabled and set the appropriate environment variable with your API key:

```bash
export GOOGLE_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
```

3. Run the application:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

4. Access the application in your web browser at http://localhost:8501.

### Code Structure

The `app.py` file contains the main logic of the application, including:

* Functions for processing PDFs and extracting text.
* Creating embeddings for the text using Google's generative AI model.
* Searching for similar passages based on user input.
* Utilizing a question-answering chain powered by Gemini-1.5-pro to generate a response.
* Building the Streamlit interface for user interaction.

### Disclaimer

This is a sample application and might require further customization depending on your specific needs. The accuracy of the answers generated by Gemini-1.5-pro depends on the quality of the input PDFs and the clarity of the questions.
